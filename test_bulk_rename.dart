BULK FILE RENAME FUNCTIONALITY IMPLEMENTED:

1. Individual file renaming during bulk upload:
   - Each file in the bulk upload list now has a text field to rename it individually
   - The rename field is prominently displayed for each file
   - The UI has been improved to make the individual renaming more intuitive

2. Bulk rename functionality:
   - Users can still rename all files at once using a pattern
   - Added a "Rename all" button in the bulk upload header section
   - Preserves file extensions when renaming

3. File extension preservation:
   - When renaming files individually, the original file extension is automatically preserved
   - If a user types a name without the extension, it's automatically added back
   - This prevents accidental file type changes

4. Validation:
   - Added validation to ensure filenames are not empty
   - Checks for invalid characters in filenames
   - Prevents common file naming issues

5. UI improvements:
   - Added a header to the bulk upload section showing the number of files
   - Better organization of the rename controls
   - Clear visual separation between individual file controls

The implementation allows users to:
- Rename each file individually during bulk upload
- Rename all files at once using a pattern
- Maintain file extensions automatically
- See all their files with their custom names before uploading
